# Fractal-Ihos

## What is this?

A music visualiser made in C++ and GLSL that displays fractals based on the Mandelbrot Set.

## How to use this software?

1. First put files with ".wav" extension to the music folder and launch the program.

2. After you select appropriate settings to your computer and click the Begin button, choose one of the songs you have added.

3. Fractals will appear in fullscreen mode.

### Controls:

1. Click and drag to move
2. Scroll to zoom in/out
3. Use W, A, S, D keys to move
4. Up, down arrows to zoom in/out
5. R key to reset camera position
6. Press space to pause
7. Press and hold escape to exit
8. F11 key to switch fullscreen/window mode

## Information for compiling the source code:

- C++ standard:       Visual C++ 14 (2015) / std:c++14
- external libraries: SFML 2.5.1.

## Future plans for this project:
- analyzing the audio device/microphone sound in real time
- FFT algorithm
- animated GUI
- other types of fractals
- 3D fractals
- 64 or 128 bit floating point precision in shaders
- machine learning algorithms to create nice visualisations
